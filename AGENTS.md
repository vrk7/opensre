# Tracer Agent – Project Overview for AI Coding Assistant

## Workflow Expectations

- When “push” is mentioned, it means pushing the commit to GitHub and verifying that all linting checks and GitHub Actions pass for that commit.
- Before pushing any changes, always run `make demo` locally.

## Sensitive Data

- Never commit API keys, tokens, or secrets of any kind.

## Testing Approach

- Write tests as integration tests only. Do not use mock services.
- Tests should live alongside the code they validate.
- If the source file is large, create a separate test file in the same directory using the `_test.py` suffix.

Example:

```
app/agent/nodes/frame_problem/frame_problem.py
app/agent/nodes/frame_problem/frame_problem_test.py
```

## Linting

- Ruff is the only linter used in this project.
- Linting must pass before any push.

## Environment

- Do not use virtual environments.
- Use the system `python3` directly.

## Best Practices

- Always run linters before committing.
- Always validate changes with `make test`.
- Follow Go-style discipline in structure and formatting where applicable.
- Review all changes for potential security implications.

## What Not to Do

- Do not introduce fallback logic that relies on mock or fake data.
- Do not bypass tests or CI checks.

## GitHub Push and CI Verification Protocol

“Push” means completing the full push cycle, not just running `git push`.

### Required Steps Before Declaring a Push Successful

1. Ensure working tree is clean.
2. Run `make test` locally.
3. Run linters locally (`ruff`).
4. Push the branch to GitHub.

### Required Steps After Pushing

1. Verify GitHub authentication is working.
2. If `gh` reports HTTP 401, run `gh auth login`.
3. Ensure `GITHUB_TOKEN` is correctly scoped or unset if using `gh` credentials.
4. Check GitHub Actions for the pushed branch:
   - `gh run list --branch <branch> --limit N`
5. Identify the most recent workflow run for the commit.
6. Confirm CI status:
   - All required workflows must complete successfully.
   - A failed or cancelled workflow means the push is not complete.

### Failure Handling

- If CI fails, investigate and fix before proceeding.
- Do not proceed assuming CI will “probably pass”.
- If authentication blocks CI inspection, resolve auth first before continuing work.

### Completion Definition

A push is only considered complete when:

- Code is pushed.
- CI has run.
- CI has passed.

Optional but recommended:

- Capture CI run ID in commit or task notes.
- Call out infra or CI failures explicitly if unrelated to code changes.

### Why This Helps

- Prevents silent CI failures.
- Prevents broken demo branches.
- Forces agents to treat CI as part of the development loop, not an afterthought.

### Hard Rule

Never say “pushed” unless CI has been checked and verified green.


### Local Repositories 
#### Local Repository Layout (User-Specific: Vincent Only)

The following local repository paths apply only to Vincent’s development environment and must not be assumed for any other user, agent, or runtime.

They are provided strictly for orientation during local development.

Hard rule: These paths must never be hard-coded into commits, configuration files, tests, or documentation intended for general use.

Backend + Web App (Next.js)

Any agent operating outside Vincent’s local machine must treat repository discovery as dynamic and environment-driven.
