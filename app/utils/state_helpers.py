    Extract all executed sources from hypotheses history.

    This function consolidates the logic for extracting executed evidence sources
    from the state's executed_hypotheses history. It handles both the legacy
    single "source" field and the newer "sources" list field.

    Args:
        state: The investigation state containing executed_hypotheses

    Returns:
        A set of all evidence source names that have been executed

    Example:
        >>> state = {"executed_hypotheses": [
        ...     {"source": "tracer_web", "sources": ["tracer_web", "batch"]},
        ...     {"source": "cloudwatch"}
        ... ]}
        >>> get_executed_sources(state)
        {"tracer_web", "batch", "cloudwatch"}
